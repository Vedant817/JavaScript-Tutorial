// In HTML if a tag is not closed properly then it is auto corrected by the browser but in the console we can still see the warning for the same.
// If something is written outside the body tag,then while it is launched then the content will come inside the body tag automatically.
// ** Head-> document.head  Body-> document.body  Element-> document.documentElement
// ** document.title returns a string in place of an object. script tag before the body tag actually returns null.
